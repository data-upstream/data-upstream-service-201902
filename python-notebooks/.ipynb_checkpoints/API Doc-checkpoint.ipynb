    "# Introduction\n",
    "## Authenticated Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of access tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User access tokens - these tokens are granted to users via the user\n",
    "   registration and sign in endpoints.\n",
    "2. Device access tokens - these tokens are granted to devices via the device\n",
    "   creation endpoint. During device creation, more than one access tokens may be\n",
    "   granted. The usage of these tokens depend on the key rotation system config.\n",
    "   If key rotation is enabled, these tokens must be used in sequence (i.e.,\n",
    "   key 1 follow by key 2 follow by key 3 and so on and come back to key 1). If\n",
    "   key rotation is disabled, _any_ of the tokens can be used at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticated endpoints have to be called with an access token. The token (both\n",
    "user access token and device access token) should be specified in the\n",
    "`X-Access-Token` header field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain authenticated endpoints accept **only** user access tokens, **only**\n",
    "device access tokens, or **both** user and device access tokens. Such\n",
    "requirements will be documented at each endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an access token is not specified or is invalid, authenticated endpoints will\n",
    "respond with HTTP status code 401 (unauthorized). Such response will be omitted\n",
    "from the documentation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain resources, such as devices, _belong_ to users. As such, not all access\n",
    "tokens will be accepted. For example, if a device belongs to a user Alice,\n",
    "another user Bob cannot use his access tokens to update this device. Any attempt\n",
    "to do so will be rejected and the endpoint will respond with HTTP status code\n",
    "403 (forbidden). Such response will be omitted from the documentation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "An error is indicated by HTTP status code of 400-499. When this happens, the\n",
    "response will be a JSON object with an `errors` property which contains an array\n",
    "of strings describing the errors. For example, if the user registration endpoint\n",
    "is called without any parameters, the endpoint will repond with HTTP status code\n",
    "422 (unprocessable entity) along with the following body:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"errors\": [\n",
    "    \"Email can't be blank\",\n",
    "    \"Password can't be blank\"\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paging\n",
    "Endpoints that produce lists of resources (such as list of devices, list of\n",
    "device access tokens, etc) support paging. Paging can be controlled using the\n",
    "following optional query parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page` - The page number. This value starts from 1. This value defaults to 1.\n",
    "- `limit` - The maximum number resources to return in the list. This value\n",
    "  defaults to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources are ordered by the id of the resources in descending order (i.e.,\n",
    "newer resources appear in earlier pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that paging is implemented using SQL limit and offset. As such there is a\n",
    "possibility of entering a race condition with resource creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we are listing some resources whose valid ids are 1-100. Suppose we\n",
    "set limit to 5. Consider the following sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get page = 1. This will return ids 96-100.\n",
    "2. Create new resource. Suppose this resource has id 101.\n",
    "3. Get page = 2. This will return ids 92-96.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that id 96 is returned twice. Hence, if your application is enumerating\n",
    "through pages of a list, remember to keep a list of visited ids to prevent\n",
    "double processing (unless the processing operation is idempotent).\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters will be omitted from the documentation below.\n",
    "\n",
